## 🚀 To Get Started - 5 Steps

### 1️⃣ Get Firebase Credentials
```
Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
→ Generate New Private Key → Download JSON file

From the JSON, copy:
- project_id (e.g., task-edd4d)
- private_key (the full key including -----BEGIN/END-----)
- client_email (e.g., firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@task-edd4d.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
```

### 2️⃣ Create Gmail App Password
```
Gmail Account → Security → 2-Factor Authentication (enable if not done)
→ App passwords → Mail → Generate 16-character password
```

### 3️⃣ Add GitHub Secrets
```
GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
→ Create these 5 secrets:

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = task-edd4d
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY = (the full private_key from JSON with \n kept)
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL = firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@task-edd4d.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GMAIL_USER = your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD = your-16-char-app-password
```

### 4️⃣ Enable GitHub Actions
```
GitHub Repo → Settings → Actions
→ Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" → Save
```

### 5️⃣ Test the System
```
1. Create a task assigned to a member
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Check the recipient's notification email inbox
4. Should see "New Task Assigned" email
```

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### View Workflow Status
```
GitHub Repo → Actions tab
→ See all 5 workflows with their status
→ Click a workflow to see execution history
→ Click a specific run to see detailed logs
```

### Example Success Log
```
✅ Email sent to kingfordnabor20@gmail.com for task: Finish Chapter 3
✅ Email sent to allancorral084@gmail.com for announcement: Monthly Meeting
✅ Email sent to johnpaulbugayong14@gmail.com for ticket: Software Issue
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Emails not being sent?

**Check 1: Are workflows running?**
- Go to Actions tab
- Should see recent workflow runs
- If red X: click to see error logs

**Check 2: Are GitHub Secrets correct?**
- Settings → Secrets → verify all 5 exist
- FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY should still have `\n` characters
- GMAIL_PASSWORD should be app password (16 chars with spaces)

**Check 3: Is Gmail authentication working?**
- Verify 2-Factor Authentication enabled on Gmail
- Verify using App Password (not regular password)
- Check Gmail spam folder

**Check 4: Did the record get created after secrets were added?**
- Workflows only process records created AFTER they started running
- Try creating a new task/announcement/poll/ticket

### Manual Test
```
Actions tab → click "Send Task Email Notifications" workflow
→ Click "Run workflow" button
→ Select "Main" branch
→ Click "Run workflow"
→ Watch the logs in real-time
```

## 📋 No Changes Needed to Frontend

The **existing admin.js and member.js code works as-is**!

- When admin creates task → stored in Firestore
- GitHub Action picks it up → sends email
- When member creates ticket → stored in Firestore
- GitHub Action picks it up → sends email to admin

No code modifications required! ✅

## 🎓 Email Workflow Details

### 1. Admin Creates Task
```
admin.js → User clicks "Create Task"
         ↓
        Creates task in Firestore (NO emailNotificationSent field yet)
         ↓
        GitHub Action runs every 5 minutes
         ↓
        Detects task with missing emailNotificationSent field
         ↓
        Sends email to member's notification email
         ↓
        Updates Firestore: emailNotificationSent = true
         ↓
        ✅ Done! Next time workflow runs, ignores this task
```

### 2. GitHub Action Sends Reminder
```
send-task-reminders.yml runs 3x daily (9 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM UTC)
         ↓
        Gets all pending tasks with status = "pending"
         ↓
        For each task, calculates days until deadline
         ↓
        If 1-3 days away:
          └─ Check if already sent reminder today
          └─ If not, send "Due Soon" email
          └─ Update: lastDueSoonNotificationDate = today
         ↓
        If overdue:
          └─ Check if already sent overdue warning today
          └─ If not, send "Overdue" warning email
          └─ Update: lastOverdueNotificationDate = today
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **Test each workflow individually**
